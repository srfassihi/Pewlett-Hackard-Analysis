## Overview
Pewlett Hackard (PH) is an aging organization with major risk of knowledge and productivity loss due to current employees approaching retirement age. Our goal is to analyze the knowledge and experience gap from an upcoming wave of retirement.  

## Results
1. ~90K employees are due for retirement (Ages 65 to 70), while there are only ~1.5K employees are eligible for mentorship.
2. 63% of the employees due for retirement hold senior titles while 32% hold entry level titles. Less than 5% of retiring employees hold leadership positions. This indicates a lack of promotion.

3. There are around 2x the percentage of mentorship candidate employees holding an 'Engineer I' position than the retirement-ready employees. Management should consider promotion of qualified Engineer I to Senior Engineer and Senior Engineer to Staff Engineer to maintain a similar hierarchy in the company.

4. Sufficient qualified retirement-ready employees can be used for mentoring and on-boarding new PH employees in all levels except Manager. The Technique Leader pool should be evaluated as potential Managers.

## Summary
PH currently lacks staff born after 1966 possibly due to insufficient recruitment for entry level positions. A shocking 48% of employees due for retirement still hold a title of Engineer II or below showing a lack of promotion. From the outside perspective PH appears less appealing due to low career advancement opportunities and lack of younger employees. Pewlett Hackard will soon face a tremendous burden of providing pensions for retirees. In order to prevent the worst case scenario, HR must come up with a strategy to replace a large number of employees at all levels, and management should consider various forms of corporate restructuring to ensure PH can sustain itself as a leaner and greener organization. The IS Department should collaborate with the PH employees close to retirement to identify solutions to boost effiency and value per employee such as task automation, newer technology and tools, and develop comprehensive training programs for new employees.
